# Get Additional Help
This page outlines the additional ways you can get help from us or contact us, should this knowledgebase not suffice.

If you're reporting abuse, please use our [dedicated abuse email](mailto:abuse@actinium.cloud)!

## Discord (recommended)

The best way to get support from us is through our official Discord server. You can join it [here](https://actiniumcloud.com/discord).

We recommend Discord tickets as the main method of getting support as it means your ticket will be responded to the fastest versus other methods.

## Billing Tickets

You can also open tickets on our myGame Panel (AKA Game Cloud) if you have servers on it. You can open a ticket on myGame [here](https://my.actiniumcloud.com/ticket).

## Email Support

Only use email support if the above options aren't viable for you. For abuse emails, please use our [dedicated abuse email](mailto:abuse@actinium.cloud).

For all other queries, you can email us at [hello@actinium.cloud](mailto:hello@actinium.cloud) or [contact@actinium.cloud](mailto:contact@actinium.cloud). Both inboxes work the same.
