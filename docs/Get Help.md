# Get Additional Help
This page outlines the additional ways you can get help from us, should this knowledgebase not suffice.

[If you're reporting abuse, please use our dedicated abuse email!](mailto:abuse@actinium.cloud)

## Discord (recommended)

The best way to get support from us is through our official Discord server. You can join it [here](https://actiniumcloud.com/discord)

We recommend Discord tickets as the main method of getting support as it means your ticket will be responded to the fastest versus other methods.

## Billing Tickets

You can also open tickets on our myGame Panel if you use it. You can do so [here](https://my.actiniumcloud.com/ticket).
