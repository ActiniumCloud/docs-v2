# Authentication servers are down

The player is unable to connect to the server and the console shows:
``` 
Authentication servers are down. Please try again later, sorry!
```

This means that Mojang's authentication server is down at the time, or is inaccessible due to network problems.

## Solution
1. Patiently wait until Mojang is back in service or the cause of the network problem is gone
2. Turn off online authentication in the server settings and restart the server. <a href="/docs/Minecraft/Troubleshooting/login">More info</a>
