# Stopped Servers

For our game services we operate a Pay As You Go (PAYG) model, common in the SaaS and IaaS industries. This means you pay for each server you run with us per hour. 

Even when your server is stopped, the resources it uses are still allocated to your account therefore we continue to charge you for them. The only time your stopped server isn't charged is when it has been deleted as the resources it uses get freed up to allocate to other customers.
