# Branding Rules
The rules surrounding using our brand assets!

In order to protect our brand, we have brand rules to ensure our branding is not being misused. These rules may be updated at any time and without warning. It is your responsibility to periodically check these rules for updates.

## Rules

For reference, "branding assets" refers to everything [on our branding page](./branding) and the "ActiniumCloud" or "Actinium" names.

- You cannot use our branding assets comercially without our explicit permission
- You cannot make it appear as if we are endorsing your project unless we explicitly allow you to
- You can only use our branding assets in SFW (Safe For Work) environments
