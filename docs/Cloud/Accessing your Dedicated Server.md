# Accessing your Dedicated Server

By default your Dedicated Server will boot into Rescue Mode, you can SSH into it using the rescue password provided on the Panel.

If you're unsure on how you install an Operating System via Resuce Mode, you can install a supported Linux Operating System via the Panel. Once the installation is complete, the default password will be displayed, you may change it as you wish. Make sure to keep it safe!
